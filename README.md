# Project 3 - Designing a Thread Pool

These files are a C++ version of the files that support the POSIX
implementation of the thread pool project from *Operating Systems
Concepts, 10th Edition* by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne.

## Source files:

- `client.cpp` (client program that uses thread pool)

- `threadpool.cpp` (implementation of thread pool)

- `threadpool.h` (header file containing class definition)

## Makefile

To run the make file, enter `make`

To run the example program, enter `./example`
